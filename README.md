# GameMaker Animation Curve Examples

Animation curves have a ton of uses!
I've provided 2 examples so far of how I have used animation curves in other projects:
1. Z animation
2. Probability

Other examples I plan to add over time:
1. Mutation curves, similar to probability
2. Movement acceleration
3. Actual animations such as a bow draw
